# SDET Java Coding Interview Challenges

## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of Java coding challenges designed specifically for SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) interview preparation. Each challenge includes:

- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem
- **Solutions**: Multiple approaches with explanations
- **Comments**: Detailed inline comments explaining the logic
- **Time & Space Complexity**: Analysis for each solution

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Arrays**
- Array rotation and manipulation
- Finding duplicates
- Two-pointer techniques
- Prefix sum problems

### 2. **Strings**
- Anagram detection
- Palindrome checking
- String compression
- Pattern matching

### 3. **Collections (Java)**
- HashMap/HashTable operations
- ArrayList vs LinkedList trade-offs
- Set implementations
- Sorting custom objects

### 4. **Searching & Sorting**
- Binary search variations
- Merge sort vs Quick sort
- Custom sorting with comparators
- Finding K-largest/smallest elements

### 5. **Miscellaneous**
- Math problems
- Basic recursion
- Interview-focused logic problems

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the Problem**: Open the challenge file and understand the problem statement
2. **Try to Solve**: Attempt to write your own solution first
3. **Check Solutions**: Compare with provided solutions
4. **Understand Approach**: Read comments and complexity analysis
5. **Practice**: Modify solutions, add edge case handling

## Important Notes

- Each solution is written in a **readable, interview-style** format
- Comments focus on **explaining logic**, not just describing code
- Complexity analysis helps understand **trade-offs** between approaches
- All solutions follow **best practices** and **clean code principles**

## Common Interview Questions

These challenges cover questions commonly asked at companies like:
- Broadridge, Capgemini, TCS, Infosys
- FAANG companies
- Product-based startups

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Basic IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse)
- Familiarity with common data structures

### Running Solutions

```bash
# Compile
javac src/challenges/arrays/RotateArray.java

# Run
java -cp src challenges.arrays.RotateArray
```

## Tips for Interview Success

1. **Understand Before Coding**: Ask clarifying questions
2. **Think Aloud**: Explain your approach to the interviewer
3. **Optimize**: Start with brute force, then optimize
4. **Edge Cases**: Always test with edge cases
5. **Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names, good formatting
